I am a PhD student at [AIML](https://aiml.inf.ed.ac.uk/) lab in the School of Informatics, [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), working towards the meets of Blockchain and IoT. I received my MS degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), China in 2020. My research interests include access control in IoT, Business Process Management and Blockchain Application.

I try to avoid low-hanging fruit and tune our baseline models carefully. The function of papers is to generate insight, not fractional improvements in accuracy, and a successful project is one that shapes the way researchers think long after the specific model or task being described goes out of use.
