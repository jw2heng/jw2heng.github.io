**Abstract:**

Blockchain is becoming increasingly popular, while the performance problems have confused its implementation, especially the limited size of the distributed network. In this paper, we propose Trust-PBFT, a combination of PeerTrust P2P trust calculation model and PBFT consensus algorithm. We first introduce PeerTrust to evaluate the trustworthy of the nodes that qualify as participants of PBFT, which replaces the original that all nodes participate in so that the size of the distributed network can be expanded arbitrarily. Besides, in order to simplify the structure of block storage, particularly the storage of the feedbacks of transaction used to calculate trust value of nodes, we design a tri-chain architecture to store accounts, transactions and feedbacks in three blockchains, respectively. Moreover, due to the introduction of PeerTrust, a weak benefit is to improve the fault tolerance performance efficiently. Finally, we design simulation experiments to evaluate the fault tolerance performance and scalability of Trust-PBFT.
